<main>
<p>It is important to prepare for a job interview. First, you should read the job description until you can recite it from memory. After that, write(and/or type) your questions about the position so you can ask them during the interview. After the questions are written and/or typed, do your research on the company. You should definitely know when the business was started, the names of the company president and CEO, and what products and/or services are offered.</p>
<p>After research, the next conideration is making the best first impression possible as those first moments are vital. Dress as if you were going to a wedding or funeral which means formal outfits, a lack of wrinkles, and grooming your hair in advance. The final step is making sure you greet everyone you see with a smile, starting with the first person you can see once you enter the building.</p>
